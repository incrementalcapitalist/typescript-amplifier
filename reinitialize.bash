# TypeScript Amplifier: AWS Amplify Gen 2 Project Setup Script
# Version: 1.4
# Author: Incremental Capitalist
# Date: Friday, August 9th, 2024
#
# This script automates the setup process for an AWS Amplify Gen 2 project with React and TypeScript.
# It handles system updates, installation of necessary tools, and initialization or update of an Amplify project.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - An AWS account with sufficient permissions to create and manage Amplify projects
# - An existing Amplify app created in the AWS Console (you'll need the App ID)

# Enable strict mode:
# -e: Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
# -u: Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.
# -o pipefail: The return value of a pipeline is the status of the last command
#              to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if no command exited with a non-zero status.
set -euo pipefail

# Function to log messages with timestamps

# Parameters:
#   $1: The error message to log

# TypeScript Amplifier: AWS Amplify Gen 2 Starter Template

This repository provides a starter template for AWS Amplify Gen 2 development with TypeScript and React. It includes a bash script (`initialize.bash`) that automates the setup of the necessary tools and configuration for AWS Amplify on a new environment.

Key features:

- Automated setup of AWS Amplify Gen 2 environment
- TypeScript and React integration out of the box
- Tailwind CSS configuration for rapid UI development
- Easy transfer of AWS credentials to remote environments
- Scripts for both initial setup and reinitialization on new instances

## Prerequisites

Before running the setup script, ensure you have the following:

- An **AWS account** with sufficient permissions to create and manage Amplify projects.
- An **existing Amplify app created in the AWS Console** (you'll need the App ID).
- Access to an **Ubuntu** environment (local or EC2 instance) with internet connectivity.
- **Sudo privileges** may be required for system updates and installing certain packages.

## Repository Contents

- `transfer-aws-configuration.bash`: Script to securely transfer AWS credentials to a remote server [run from your local machine].
- `initialize.bash`: Main script to set up a Gen 2 Amplify project with TypeScript and React.
- `reinitialize.bash`: Script to set up an existing TypeScript/React Amplify project on a new EC2 instance.

## Setup Instructions

### 0. Create Amplify App in AWS Console

Before running the initialization script, you need to create an Amplify app in the AWS Console:

 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
 2. Navigate to the AWS Amplify service.
 3. Click "New app" and select "Build an app".
 4. Choose a name for your app and select your preferred Git provider (or "Deploy without Git provider" if you prefer).
 5. Follow the prompts to complete the app creation.
 6. Once created, note down the App ID from the app information section. You'll need this when running the initialization script.

### 1. Copy AWS Credentials

If using a remote environment, set up the SSH config file and copy AWS credentials using the `transfer-aws-configuration.bash` script:

```bash
bash transfer-aws-configuration.bash
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine or remote environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/incrementalcapitalist/typescript-amplifier.git
cd typescript-amplifier
```

### 3. Run the Initialization Script

Run the initialization script:

```bash
bash initialize.bash
```

## Script Workflow

When you run the script, it will perform the following actions:

1. **Prompt for Project Details:**
   - You will be asked to enter a name for your AWS Amplify project. Note: The project name must be in lowercase due to npm naming restrictions.
   - You'll need to provide the App ID (found in the AWS Amplify console).
   - You'll be asked for the branch name (e.g., 'main' or 'develop').

2. **System Update and Upgrade:**
   - Updates the package index and performs a full system upgrade (requires sudo).

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Installs `unzip` and `curl` if not already installed (requires sudo).

4. **Install AWS CLI:**
   - Downloads and installs the AWS CLI (version 2) if not already installed.

5. **Install Node Version Manager (NVM) and Node.js:**
   - Installs NVM if not already installed.
   - Uses NVM to install the latest version of Node.js and npm.

6. **Install Amplify CLI:**
   - Installs the Amplify CLI globally using npm.

7. **Configure AWS CLI and Amplify CLI:**
   - Sets up AWS CLI with your credentials.
   - Attempts to configure the Amplify CLI automatically.
   - Note: You may see a message "Headless mode is not implemented for @aws-amplify/cli-internal". This can be ignored if the script continues to run successfully.

8. **Set up React TypeScript Project:**
   - Creates a new React app with TypeScript template.
   - Installs necessary dependencies including AWS Amplify and Tailwind CSS.
   - Configures Tailwind CSS.

9. **Initialize Amplify in the React App:**
   - Initializes a new Amplify Gen 2 project with the provided App ID and branch name.
   - Configures the React app to use Amplify.

## Verify Installation

After running the script, verify the installation by checking the versions of the installed tools:

```bash
nvm -v
node -v
npm -v
aws --version
amplify --version
```

## Start Developing with AWS Amplify

Navigate to the newly created Amplify project directory:

```bash
cd your-project-name
npm start
```

Replace `your-project-name` with the name you provided during script execution.


## Script Details

### AWS Credentials Transfer

The `transfer-aws-configuration.bash` script securely copies your local AWS credentials to a remote server.

### Initialize 

The `initialize.bash` script for a Typescript/React Gen 2 Amplify project.


## Troubleshooting

- **AWS CLI or Amplify CLI not recognized**: The script should install these for you. If you still encounter issues, ensure that your PATH is correctly set. You can manually add paths to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` if necessary.
- **Permission Denied Errors**: Make sure you are running the script with sufficient permissions (`sudo` may be required for some commands).
- **Script Errors:** If any errors occur during script execution, they will be logged. Review the log for troubleshooting.
- **NVM or Node.js Installation Issues**: If you encounter problems with NVM or Node.js installation, try restarting your terminal or sourcing your bash profile after the script completes.
- **Amplify CLI Installation Fails**: If the Amplify CLI installation fails, you may need to run `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli` manually after the script completes.
- **Amplify CLI Configuration: If you see the message "Headless mode is not implemented for @aws-amplify/cli-internal", don't worry. The script should continue to run successfully without requiring manual configuration. If you do encounter issues, you can try running amplify configure manually after the script completes.
- **Project Name Errors: Ensure that your project name is in lowercase. The script will prompt you to re-enter the name if it contains any capital letters.

## Reinitializing on a New EC2 Instance

If you need to set up your existing TypeScript/React Amplify project on a new EC2 instance, follow these steps:

1. Run the `transfer-aws-configuration.bash` script on your local machine to copy AWS credentials to the new EC2 instance.
2. SSH into your new EC2 instance.
3. Clone or copy your project to your local machine or remote environment:

Note: Running `ssh-keygen` may not be required if you've already set up credentials with GitHub. Otherwise, copy the contents of `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to the repository's "Deploy keys" (in "Settings"). Make sure "Allow write access" is checked if a need to update the repository is forseen.

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen
   cat /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   git clone https://github.com/incrementalcapitalist/typescript-amplifier.git
   cd typescript-amplifier
   ```
   
4. Run the reinitialization script:
   ```
   bash reinitialize.bash
   ```

This script will:
- Update the system and install necessary packages
- Install AWS CLI, NVM, Node.js, and Amplify CLI
- Verify AWS credentials
- Install project dependencies
- Initialize Amplify in the existing project

Note: This script assumes your project is already set up and you're moving it to a new EC2 instance. It does not create a new Amplify project from scratch.

## Prerequisites

Before running the setup script, ensure you have the following:

- An **AWS account** with sufficient permissions to create and manage Amplify projects.
- An **existing Amplify app created in the AWS Console** (you'll need the App ID).
- Access to an **Ubuntu** environment (local or EC2 instance) with internet connectivity.
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.
- **AWS CLI** installed and configured with your credentials.

## Repository Contents

- `transfer-aws-configuration.bash`: Script to securely transfer AWS credentials to a remote server [run from your local machine].
- `initialize.bash`: Main script to set up a Gen 2 Amplify project with TypeScript and React.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Copy AWS Credentials

If using a remote environment, set up the SSH config file and copy AWS credentials using the `transfer-aws-configuration.bash` script:

```bash
bash transfer-aws-configuration.bash
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine or remote environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/incrementalcapitalist/typescript-amplifier.git
cd typescript-amplifier
```

### 3. Run the Initialization Script

Run the initialization script:

```bash
bash initialize.bash
```

## Script Workflow

When you run the script, it will perform the following actions:

1. **Prompt for Project Details:**
   - You will be asked to enter a name for your AWS Amplify project, the App ID, and the branch name.

2. **System Update and Upgrade:**
   - Updates the package index and performs a full system upgrade (requires sudo).

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Installs `unzip` and `curl` if not already installed (requires sudo).

4. **Install AWS CLI:**
   - Downloads and installs the AWS CLI (version 2) if not already installed.

5. **Install Node Version Manager (NVM) and Node.js:**
   - Installs NVM if not already installed.
   - Uses NVM to install the latest version of Node.js and npm.

6. **Install Amplify CLI:**
   - Installs the Amplify CLI globally using npm if not already installed.

7. **Configure AWS CLI and Amplify CLI:**
   - Sets up AWS CLI with your credentials.
   - Configures Amplify CLI for use with your AWS account.

8. **Initialize a New Amplify Gen 2 Project:**
   - Creates a new directory for your project.
   - Initializes a new Amplify Gen 2 project with the provided App ID and branch name.

## Verify Installation

After running the script, verify the installation by checking the versions of the installed tools:

```bash
nvm -v
node -v
npm -v
aws --version
amplify --version
```

## Start Developing with AWS Amplify

Navigate to the newly created Amplify project directory:

```bash
cd your-project-name
npm start
```

Replace `your-project-name` with the name you provided during script execution.


## Script Details

### AWS Credentials Transfer

The `transfer-aws-configuration.bash` script securely copies your local AWS credentials to a remote server.

### Initialize 

The `initialize.bash` script for a Typescript/React Gen 2 Amplify project.


## Troubleshooting

- **AWS CLI or Amplify CLI not recognized**: Ensure that your PATH is correctly set. You can manually add paths to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` if necessary.
- **Permission Denied Errors**: Make sure you are running the script with sufficient permissions (`sudo` may be required for some commands).
- **Script Errors:** If any errors occur during script execution, they will be logged. Review the log for troubleshooting.
